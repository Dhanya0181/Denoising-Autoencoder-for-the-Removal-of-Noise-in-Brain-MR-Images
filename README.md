# Denoising-Autoencoder-for-the-Removal-of-Noise-in-Brain-MR-Images
Medical imaging techniques like X-rays, ultrasound, CT scans and MRI can show
structures of the internal body in great detail. But noise in images produced from
medical imaging equipments are common and inevitable. Hence noise removal
techniques have become an essential practice in medical imaging. Here we are
specifically concentrating on removal of noise from brain MRI images. MRI is
very efficient in providing information regarding the location of tumors and even
the volume. The noise in MRI images may be due to field strength, RF pulses, RF
coil, voxel volume, or receiver bandwidth. So we are proposing a Convolutional
Denoising Autoencoder(CDAE) for removing noise from these images. Convolutional
autoencoders are capable of retaining the spatial information of the input image and
gently extract the the data without much loss. Hence we can get more accurate
denoising with less data and lower computation.
